Patient Visit & Follow-Up Manager is a mini healthcare system built using PHP and MySQL, where all calculations such as age, follow-ups, date differences, and reports are performed strictly using SQL functions. PHP is used only to handle form inputs, execute queries, and display results. The system includes patient and visit management, follow-up scheduling, and multiple SQL-driven reports like monthly visits, overdue follow-ups, and birthdays. It also implements session-based authentication, pagination, and search features for efficient data handling. The application ensures accurate age calculation including years and months using SQL date functions. Follow-up due dates and overdue logic are fully handled inside SQL queries without PHP date processing. Monthly and summary reports are generated using SQL grouping and aggregation functions. The system identifies inactive patients and patients with no visits through SQL conditions. Proper validation is applied to prevent future dates and invalid entries. The project follows a clean folder structure for better maintainability and scalability.
